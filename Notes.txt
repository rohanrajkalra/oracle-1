[NOTE]
===============================
*Security tip:*
Always consider revoking execute on UTL_FILE, UTL_TCP, UTL_SMTP, UTL_HTTP and other UTL packages from PUBLIC, because they are granted by default and represent a treat for security.

*Things to monitor:*

-> out of UNDO, TEMP and other TBS space

-> Users quota limits

-> Objects hiting max extents limit

-> row migration (=> increase the pct_free or do a move/shrink of the object)

*To review:*
Backup check logical (RMAN command) & V$DATABASE_BLOCK_CORRUPTION

*RMAN optimization:* Oracle recommends to use `FILEPERSET` &le; 8 to optimize recovery.

*Change SQL*Plus prompt:* in ORACLE_HOME/sqlplus/admin/glogin.sql => set sqlprompt "_user@_connect_identifiers>"
